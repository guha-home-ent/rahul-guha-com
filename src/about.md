I am a father (of two), husband, resident of the lonestar state called Texas and live in a beutiful city of Flower Mound.  

I was born and raised in Calcutta, India (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Joy" target="_blank">City of Joy</a>) in pre-millenium years. Father was a journalist, mother a school teacher. 

I started my working life in a newspaper and developed first of a kind news monitoring and editorial system for them - which they used for over 10 years. 

I moved to America in 1999 and landed up in the Silicon Valley and started an exciting journey. As I sailed thtough multiple domains like Finance, Healthcare, Retail and even Legal, I also explored technologies shifting from early client server (VB, Delphi, PowerBuilder) to web (asp, jsp) to web 2.0 (API, MVC, MVVM etc) to lately Web 3.0 ( world of NFT). 

I feel humble and fortunate to witness transformation of technology and society overall in decades.
